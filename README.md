## About The Project

I started my cursus at **42 Vienna**. This is my journey through the Common Core, step by step:  

### 🏊 Step 1 – Piscine
Four intensive weeks of C, Shell and Git. The entry point into the 42 world.  

### 📚 Step 2 – First Library
- [libft](https://github.com/RubenPin90/libft) – My own C standard library.  

### 🖨️ Step 3 – Parsing & Basics
- [ft_printf](https://github.com/RubenPin90/ft_printf) – My own implementation of printf.  
- [get_next_line](https://github.com/RubenPin90/get_next_line) – Reading files line by line.

   <summary><a href="https://github.com/RubenPin90/42-Common-Core#step-3">born2beroot</a> – Setting up and securing a Linux server</summary>
  This project was about creating and configuring a virtual machine from scratch.  
  I learned how to:
  - Install and configure Debian
  - Set up partitions and a secure user environment
  - Implement SSH and firewall rules
  - Work with `sudo` policies and strong password policies
  - Document the entire setup and security measures

  It was my first real step into **system administration and cybersecurity**,  
  and it gave me a strong foundation for later projects.

- [fdf](https://github.com/RubenPin90/FdF) – My first graphics project: rendering 3D landscapes as wireframes.  

### ⚙️ Step 5 – Processes & Concurrency
- [philosophers](https://github.com/RubenPin90/Philosopher) – Multithreading, mutexes and deadlock prevention.  
- [minishell](https://github.com/RubenPin90/minishell) – My own shell with parser, builtins and process handling.  

### 🕹️ Step 6 – Advanced Projects

- [NetPractice](https://github.com/RubenPin90/NetPractice) – Network configuration fundamentals.  
- [CPP Piscine](https://github.com/RubenPin90/Cpp) – Object-oriented programming in C++.  

### 🌐 Step 7 – Networking & Virtualization
- [ft_irc](https://github.com/RubenPin90/ft_irc) – Own IRC server in C++.  
- [Inception](https://github.com/RubenPin90/Inception) – Docker and system architectures.  

### 🎮 Step 8 – Final Challenge
