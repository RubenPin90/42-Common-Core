## About The Project

I started my cursus at **42 Vienna**. This is my journey through the Common Core, step by step:  

### 🏊 Piscine
Before starting the Common Core I needed to pass a selection program by 42. Basically a 4 weeks intensive Bootcamp of C, Shell and Git. It was the real stress test to see whether I could handle 42’s peer-to-peer learning system. Every Friday there are exams to test your progess and the weekends are filled with rushes (quick 2-day group projects). The entry point into the 42 world. 

✏️ I attended the very first 42Vienna Piscine in August 2022. I had no prior coding experience, so every single day felt like a steep learning curve.
### 💫 Holy Graph
Once accepted, I got introduced to the Holy Graph, the big map that lays out the whole Common Core journey. It shows all the steps and possible paths ahead, like a roadmap of challenges waiting to be unlocked.

<br />
At the beginning, students start in the center of the Holy Graph and work their way outward through the orbits until they reach the last one, which marks the end of the Common Core. To move to the next orbit, you first need to finish all projects of the same level/orbit (There are 6 levels in total). Once the last project is done, the cursus ends with a six–month internship that every student has to find on their own. After that, you can continue with the optional masteries. Those are not required, but they are the path if you want to turn this journey into a official degree.

### 📚 Rank 1 – First Library, Parsing & Basics
- [libft](https://github.com/RubenPin90/libft) – My own C standard library.  
- [ft_printf](https://github.com/RubenPin90/ft_printf) – My own implementation of printf.  
- [get_next_line](https://github.com/RubenPin90/get_next_line) – Reading files line by line.
- <details>
   <summary>born2beroot – Setting up and securing a Linux server</summary>
  This project was about creating and configuring a virtual machine from scratch.  
  
  I learned how to install and configure Debian, set up partitions and a secure user environment, implement SSH and firewall rules, and work with sudo policies as well as strong password rules. On top of that, I documented the entire setup and the security measures I applied.

  It was my first real step into **system administration and cybersecurity**, and it gave me a strong foundation for later projects.
